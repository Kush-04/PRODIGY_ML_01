# PRODIGY_ML_01
This is my Github repository where i;
1. Implemented a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
2. Created a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
3. Implemented a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.
4. Developed a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer 
   interaction and gesture-based control systems.
5. Developed a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enabling users to track their dietary intake and make informed 
   food choices.
